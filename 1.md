1. The given DES model has involves arrival of different events based on an average arrival rate that is different for each event. Furthermore, it is given in the HW question that each of this arrival is a Poisson process with different rates. The events are summarized below:
   | Event| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   | - |:-:| :-:| :-: | :-: |
   | Type | Annual | Annual | Pay-per-ride | Bicycle returned |
   | Rate of arrival | 3 | 1 | 4 | 6 |
   | K | .5 | .1 | 1.25 | N/A |
   | Penalty | 1.00 | 0.25 | N/A | N/A |

   Thus, for each of the given we can generate discrete Poisson random variables.

   However before we can generate the random variable determining the number of each event, we have to generate an inter-arrival time for the event. As we have 4 different events in our event space from time-interval ranging from 0 to 120, we have to generate at what times do each of the event generate.

   To do this, we perform the following in the simulation. First we use a random generator provided as a `random` function to generate the event that happens next. Once we have determined the event that occurs, we generate the arrival time for that type of event. Depending on the event, the arrival time can be different as arrival times are based on the rate of Poisson process. For example in the above table, bicycles are returned back to the station at a rate of 6 while Customer 1 arrive with a rate of 3. While both are Poisson processes, the arrival time will be different as the rate of each event is different.

   Ideally, we should repeat the simulations until a desired level of precision is reached based on the confidence interval set initially (Robinson 2004). However given the statistics required and limited time, we chose to run 5 simulations. This is based on the Rule of Thumb method (Law & McComas 1990) (For more detailed information, refer to this [link](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Which_methods_are_used_to_determine_replications_run_number_for_discrete_event_simulation_Which_one_outperforms_than_the_others))

   Thus we ran the simulation 5 times and averaged the net profit to determine the net profit. In one set of simulations, we estimated the following net profits:

   1. Simulation 1 : \$634.75
   2. Simulation 1 : \$734.25
   3. Simulation 1 : \$611.25
   4. Simulation 1 : \$689.00
   5. Simulation 1 : \$642.25

   Taking the average of all the 5 simulations, we arrived at a net profit of \$662.30.

2. Response to Q1(b):

   1. When merging various Poisson process, the result of superpositions of Poisson processes is itself a Poisson process with a rate equal to the sum of the constituent processes. In this case, we end with a Poisson process. Thus in this case, the resultant distribution M is also a Poisson process with a rate lambda of 14.
   2. From the 5 simulations done in the previous case, we had an average of 39 events of various kinds occurring within the given time interval. We can use the Inverse-CDF to generate the arrival times for each of the event.

   In this case, similar to previous simulation, we ran 5 repetitions of the model to generate a net profit.

3. In both cases, we run Poisson processes. However the superposition method of combining Poisson processes can require larger computation than the former. This is due to the computation required to generate exponential arrival times. Note that arrival interval times between discrete Poisson processes is a continuous process and generated using exponential distribution.
